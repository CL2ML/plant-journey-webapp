# Prototype for the Plant Journey App

## Purpose

Do you always wanted to find the right plant that suits your individual requirements? Well, we developed a solution.

Usually, it is not so easy to find a well suited plant and to find easy to understand care instructions. So the idea for PlantJourney was born: a web app that helps plant lovers find the right plant for their personal requirements. The web app was then realized by a motivated team that found each other through the WebDev, Data Science and AI BootCamp of [TechLabs Berlin](https://www.techlabs.org/location/Berlin). 

The prototype for the idea has been built in only six weeky by a group with diverse skill sets.

We encourage you to try out the [PlantJourney App](plantjourney-proto.herokuapp.com) on your own.

## Architecture and dependencies

The app is built on top of two main components: (1) The PlantJourney Web app and (2) an image recognition API server.

__Business logic:__

The user can upload an image from a unknown plant which will recognized by a deep learning model. After the image upload, the web app makes an API request and sends the file to the image recognition API. The web app receives the recognized plant class in return. The plant class will then be used to query the database for more information on the recognized plant (e.g. water and light requirements). The     


__PlantJourney Web app:__

- Backend:
    - Flask web app
    - Gunicorn app server (used by heroku)
    - Heroku.com Hosting Server
    - PostgreSQL database by heroku 
- Frontend: plain JavaScript, HTML, CSS as well as Jinja

__PlantJourney image recognition API server:__

The image recognition API was also built with Flask and is hosted on heroku.com. The image recognition model [ResNet34](https://docs.fast.ai/vision.models.html) has been trained with [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/). Fast.ai is also used in production - yes, it works just fine! If you want find out more about the image recognition API, have a look at this [github repo](https://github.com/CM2ML/plant-recognition-api).
