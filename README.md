Using the Flask Framework for the Backend.

## Architecture

PlantJourney Web app <-> Image recognition API server

__Business logic:__

The user can upload an image from a unknown plant which will recognized by a deep learning model. After the image upload, the web app makes an API request and sends the file to the image recognition API. The web app receives the recognized plant class in return. The plant class will then be used to query the database for more information on the recognized plant (e.g. water and light requirements). The     


__PlantJourney Web app:__

- Backend:
    - Flask web app
    - Gunicorn app server (used by heroku)
    - Heroku.com Hosting Server
    - PostgreSQL database by heroku 
- Frontend: plain JavaScript, HTML, CSS as well as Jinja

__PlantJourney image recognition API server:__

The image recognition API was also built with Flask and is hosted on heroku.com. The image recognition model [ResNet34](https://docs.fast.ai/vision.models.html) has been trained with [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/). Fast.ai is also used in production - yes, it works just fine! If you want find out more about the image recognition API, have a look at this [github repo](https://github.com/CM2ML/plant-recognition-api).
